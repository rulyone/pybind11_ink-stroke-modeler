# Pybind11 bindings for the Ink Stroke Modeler Google Library

*Why?*

C++ libraries are fast. Really fast. If they're well written with a good interface (such as this case), using python bindings is best to maintain C++ performance while enabling its usage in Python code through pybind11 instead of rewriting it. 

Also, I'm expanding my expertise in advanced Python concepts, including the integration of C++ interfaces through bindings. This enables me to utilize high-performance libraries in Artificial Intelligence projects, where Python is widely adopted.

## Requirements

Python 3.10 (other versions could work, but not tested)
CMake 3.19 or higher (tested with 3.25)
